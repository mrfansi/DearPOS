   Then stock should be updated
   And movement should be recorded
   ```

### 3.3 Sales Module
1. Create Sale:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: New cash sale
   Given products are in stock
   When user adds items to cart
   And processes cash payment
   Then sale should be completed
   And stock should be reduced
   And receipt should be printed
   
   Scenario: Split payment
   Given sale total is calculated
   When user splits payment methods
   Then all payments should match total
   And sale should be completed
   ```

2. Return Sale:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: Full return
   Given sale exists
   When user processes full return
   Then refund should be issued
   And stock should be returned
   
   Scenario: Partial return
   Given sale exists
   When user selects items to return
   Then partial refund should be issued
   And selected stock should be returned
   ```

### 3.4 Inventory Module
1. Stock Take:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: Full stock take
   Given products exist
   When user counts all stock
   And submits stock take
   Then variances should be calculated
   And stock should be adjusted
   
   Scenario: Cycle count
